# Setup
## Prerequisites
You need:
  - a Discord server with a channel you want to use for the chat bridge
  - a server/virtual machine running **Windows** with **FFXIV constantly as your focussed window**  
     - > **Note**
       While you can use a free trial account, channels like Free Company chats will require you to be a member of the Free Company, which is only possible with an active subscription
     - on it, the following software needs to be installed:
       - [.NET 7.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
       - the latest version [Final Fantasy XIV](https://freetrial.finalfantasyxiv.com)
       - the latest release of [this app](https://github.com/ViMaSter/FFXIVDiscordChatBridge/releases) extracted into any directory  
         Replace future occurrences of `<appDirectory>` with this directory.
  - a Pulseway account [**with 2FA disabled**](https://forum.pulseway.com/topic/4645-operation-refused-as-the-account-has-2fa-enabled-options/#comment-15874)

12. [Fetch all systems for your Pulseway account](https://api.pulseway.com/#get-all-systems) and note down the `identifier` of the system you want to use  
    Replace future occurrences of `<pulsewayInstanceID>` with this identifier
13. Run the following command:
   ```ps
       <appDirectory>/discord-chat-bridge.exe \
           --pulsewayUsername=<pulsewayUsername> \
           --pulsewayPassword=<pulsewayPassword> \
           --pulsewayInstanceID=<pulsewayInstanceID> \

           --ffxivChannelCode=<ffxivChannelCode> \
           --ffxivWorldName=<ffxivWorldName>
   ```
13. Wait for a few seconds and check if the bot has joined the server channel    
14. As soon as the bot has joined Discord, you should see in-game messages sent to the specified Discord channel and vice versa

# Linking Discord Usernames and Character Names

To have both your character name and discord username shown whenever you send a message on either platform, you can link your Discord account to your FFXIV character.
1. Inside Discord, send a direct message to your bot containing your full character name and server (e.g. `Haurchefant Greystone@Zalera`)
2. You will receive a confirmation message from the bot in Discord; follow the instructions to confirm your character in FFXIV
