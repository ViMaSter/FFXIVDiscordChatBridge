> **Warning**
> This app requires a **dedicated** FFXIV account and client running **on Windows** with **uninterrupted keyboard input**.      
> **You can't run this bot using the same account or machine you normally play on.**

# Setup
## Prerequisites
You need:
- a Discord server with a channel you want to use for the chat bridge
- a server/virtual machine running **Windows** with **FFXIV constantly as your focussed window**
   - > **Note**
     While you can use a free trial account, channels like Free Company chats will require you to be a member of the Free Company, which is only possible with an active subscription
   - on it, the following software needs to be installed:
      - [.NET 7.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
      - the latest version [Final Fantasy XIV](https://freetrial.finalfantasyxiv.com)
      - the latest release of [this app](https://github.com/ViMaSter/FFXIVDiscordChatBridge/releases) extracted into any directory  
        Replace future occurrences of `<appDirectory>` with this directory.

## Configuration
1. [Create a Discord application with "Bot" functionality](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Generate/reset and copy the bot token

   ![image](https://i.vimaster.de/direct/ffxiv-webhook.png)  
   Replace future occurrences of `<discordWebhookURL>` with the copied URL
8. Based on the Final Fantasy XIV channel you want the bot to use, [select the corresponding ID from this page](https://gist.github.com/quisquous/1a6ea3cf102c65e3c375186f1173dff3#file-ffxiv-game-log-ids)  
   Example:
   - If you want your bot to read messages [from linkshell #1, use `0010`](https://gist.github.com/quisquous/1a6ea3cf102c65e3c375186f1173dff3#file-ffxiv-game-log-ids-L8)
   - If you want your bot to read messages [from your Free Company chat use `0018`](https://gist.github.com/quisquous/1a6ea3cf102c65e3c375186f1173dff3#file-ffxiv-game-log-ids-L16)
   Replace future occurrences of `<ffxivChannelCode>` with this ID
9. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/ViMaSter/FFXIVDiscordChatBridge/releases)
10. Run FFXIV using DirectX11 on Windows (DirectX9 and other platforms are not supported) in windowed mode
11. Note down which world your bot is on  
    Replace future occurrences of `<ffxivWorldName>` with this world name
12. Run the following command:
   ```ps
       <appDirectory>/discord-chat-bridge.exe \
           --discordWebhookURL=<discordWebhookURL> \
           --discordChannelID=<discordChannelID> \
           --discordToken=<discordToken> \
           --ffxivChannelCode=<ffxivChannelCode> \
           --ffxivWorldName=<ffxivWorldName>
   ```

# Usage
## Regular chats
1. Wait for a few seconds and check if the bot has joined the server channel
2. As soon as the bot has joined Discord, you should see in-game messages sent to the specified Discord channel and vice versa

## Linking Discord Usernames and Character Names
To have both your character name and discord username shown whenever you send a message on either platform, you can link your Discord account to your FFXIV character.
1. Inside Discord, send a direct message to your bot containing your full character name and server (e.g. `Haurchefant Greystone@Zalera`)
2. You will receive a confirmation message from the bot in Discord; follow the instructions to confirm your character in FFXIV

# High-level technical design: Producers and Consumers
This app is split into consumers and producers respectively:
- **Producers** simply take a pre-formatted message and send it to their respective app
- **Consumers** watch for incoming messages from their respective app, convert the incoming message into a pre-formatted message for the other format and pass it to their assigned producer

**FFXIV** and **Discord** have both a **Consumer** and **Producer** each.

Both consumers and producers are instantiated with configuration properties that only relate to their specific purpose (consuming FFXIV chat logs or producing Discord messages) in the constructor.  
In the next step, they are `Start()`ed, which is the point at which events are bound (for example to send messages to a now-set-up producer inside a consumer).

> Note: This has the downside that a constructed but not-yet-"linked" Producer could already be used to attempt sending content, which would fail. Maybe redesign this?

Implementation details for each producer and consumer can be found in their respective file headers.
